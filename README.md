# Overview
The Sorting Visualizer is an interactive web-based tool that helps users understand and visualize how various sorting algorithms work. It provides a graphical representation of sorting processes, allowing users to see how elements are compared, swapped, and arranged in real-time. The tool includes multiple sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Shell Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.

# Deployment
Deployed Link - https://shashank-sorting-visualiser.netlify.app/

# Features
### Interactive Visualization:
- Watch each algorithm sort an array step-by-step with real-time visual feedback.
### Multiple Sorting Algorithms:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Shell Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort

### Adjustable Settings:
- Control the speed of the visualization.
- Adjust the size of the array to see how different algorithms perform on small and large datasets.
### Randomize Array:
- Shuffle the array with a click to test different sorting scenarios.
- Clean UI: Simple and user-friendly interface for better learning and exploration.

# How to run modules

 * In order to start visualizer you have to press start button.
 * after pressing start select your algo and press go.
 * after pressing go button you can adjust the speed of visualizer and the size of bars low to high.
 * you can also randomize the bars anytime by pressing the randomize button.
 * After pressing start you can see visualizer of your algo.

# How it works

```sh
Sorting - Sorting Visualizer

    methods
        - bubble sort
        - selection sort
        - insertion sort
        - shell sort
        - quick sort

    set algo 
        - set algo acc to user's selection
    game start 
        - remove unneccesory things from screen
    clear canvas
        - clear the canvas by removing items from it
    set algo heading 
        - set the heading based on method user selects
    reset bars
        - reset all bars from screen
    make bars
        - make bars to screen by taking size as parameter
    draw bars
        - display that bars which you build to screen
    go 
        - when user start the game
        - clear canvas()
        - set algo heading()
        - make bars()
    clean array
        - set array to perticular parameter
    change color 
        - changes color of that element 
    set time 
        - event which is trigger when user change the slider 
    set size    
        - event which is trigger when user change the size of bars
    set array color
        - set the colors of array
    randomize bars
        - reset bars and make new bars
    different sorting algo
        - take the bars
        - sort with time sleep and color change
    start Visualizer
        - clean array()
        - diable sliders()
        - turn on Visualizer acc to sorting algo
